WinRemote IndigoPlugin

This is a plugin for Indigodomo (www.indigodomo.com)

It allows Windows Computers to be created as seperate plugin devices, offering a number of control options as well as Turn On/Turn Off and Messaging capibilities

It does this through using a seperate small Windows app which is then run on the Windows Computer; enabling two way-communication (after a fashion)
